# AMLToolkit
The AutomationML Toolkit is a set of UI-Controls and Templates, that may be helpful for AutomationML Content processing. 

The AutomationML Toolkit provides basic UI controls for the AutomationML editor. The main UI element, provided by the toolkit is the AMLTreeView used to visualize the AutomationML libraries as a hierarchical structure. The toolkit will automatically update a tree when the related AMLDocument is modified. Icons and styles used by the toolkit are defined in the AMLEditorSkins repository.
