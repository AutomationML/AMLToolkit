# AMLToolkit
The AutomationML Toolkit is a set of UI-Controls and Templates, that may be helpful for AutomationML Content processing. 

See the documentation pages for a getting started guide.

This first version contains a WPF Custom Control, which can be used to visualize an AutomationML Object and selected
descendants in a WPF TreeView. The TreeView Nodes are decorated with Icons which are specific for each CAEX-Element.
